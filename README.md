This script is to be run over ECG data that has been pre-processed using a Walsh-Hadamard Transform following the steps described in the paper.

Results reported in the paper were obtained by running this script on
pre-processed dataset E-HOL-03-202-003, provided by the Telemetric and
ECG Warehouse (THEW) of University of Rochester.

This script produces an Excel spreadsheet as output. The name is based on the actual date, followed by a random suffix. The spreadsheet contains all parameters discussed in the paper.
